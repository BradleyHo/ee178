# EE 178 - Digital Design with FPGAs

## Laboratory Assignment #5

In this laboratory assignment, we are implementing a piano keyboard on the Real Digital Blackboard FPGA. There are 16 notes for a total of 16 bits for the 4 inputs since 2^4 = 16 possible cases. We will be completing the code and use case statements for the 16 notes as well as hush input, clock, and our output is the 3.5 mm headphone jack which is wired to a Linsoul BLON BL-03 in-ear monitors (IEM).
