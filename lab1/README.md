# EE 178 - Digital Design with FPGAs

## Laboratory Assignment #1

In this laboratory assignment, we're implementing a two-input and one-output XOR logic gate. This assignment is a review of EE 118 to help us refresh basic EDA skills using Xilinx Vivado including design simulation, design synthesis, design implementation, and bitstream generation.

| Input | Input | Output |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| __A__ | __B__ | __A âŠ• B__ |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 |

This is a [YouTube video]() demonstrating the verification process of the XOR logic gate on the Real Digital Blackboard.
