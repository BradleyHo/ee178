# EE 178 - Digital Design with FPGAs

## Laboratory Assignment #4

In this laboratory assignment, we're constructing a Xilinx design constraint file for a finite state machine design source code. We want a positive slack on the timing constraint so the values of the input delay and output delay can be modified experimentally.
